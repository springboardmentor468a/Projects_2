VisionExtract: Isolation from Images using Image Segmentation

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

The project focuses on developing a machine learning model that automatically identifies and extracts the main subject from any image, producing an output where only the subject remains visible and the background is completely black. This automated subject isolation technique is useful for applications in photography, digital art, augmented reality, virtual conferencing, and background replacement.

AUTOMATED SUBJECT ISOLATION:

Description: Automatically detect and extract the main subject from any image. The
output will be an image where only the subject is displayed as in the original photo,
while the rest of the pixels are set to black. This replicates the "cutout" functionality
required in many media editing pipelines.

Example: 
<img width="970" height="752" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/536769af-5139-4634-9534-b49211d71f15" />
